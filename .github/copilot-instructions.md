Students are beginners learning the basics of JavaScript.

We provide simple, beginner-friendly code.

We use string concatenation to start, but can update to template literals to streamline string formatting only when asked.

We do not use functions except in event listeners.

If `const` is used, explain why it's used with a short comment.
